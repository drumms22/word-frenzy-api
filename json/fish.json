The Bay of Biscay fishery is a sustainable choice. The Cantabrian Sea (Bay of Biscay) purse seine anchovy fishery is certified by the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) as sustainable. Anchovy are a species with a low vulnerability and high resilience and as such can sustain high levels of fishing pressure. However, recruitment of young fish to the stock is affected by environmental factors including climatic fluctuations. If recruitment is low and fishing pressure too high the stock becomes vulnerable to collapse. Anchovy are also a species at or near the base of the food chain and the impact of their large-scale removal on the marine ecosystem is poorly understood."

Due to the last El Nino, anchovy populations are low and therefore a suite of management measures have been implemented to ensure anchovy populations can rebuild. However, there needs to be more transparency in stock assessments and quotas need to be made more appropriate for predators of anchovy."

Bream are generally farmed in open sea pens and are fed a diet reliant on wild fish capture. Bream farmed in this way can cause some environmental concerns, which is why bream farmed in recirculating aquaculture systems that have no interaction with the surrounding environment are a good choice. Many of the concerns of open water production are addressed by organic production standards, making both organically and land based farmed bream good seafood choices. These concerns include pollution from both nutrients and organic matters that lead to environmental changes; escaped farmed fish; disease transfer between farmed and wild species; widespread use of chemicals and some remaining concerns surrounding enforcement and regulatory controls. Bream are carnivorous fish that require more fish in their diet than farming them actually produces, leading to a net loss of marine proteins and oils.

There are four main types of cartilaginous fish; sharks, skates and rays (collectively called elasmobranchs) and chimaeras (found in deep water). Reproduction in sharks and rays is a very slow process as they generally have a late age of sexual maturity, produce few young and have a long gestation period. Shark eggs may develop in one of three different ways: Eggs are held within a leathery case (Oviparity), known as a mermaids purse e.g. catshark; embryos develop within the mother and are nourished by the egg (Ovoviparity) e.g. basking shark; Embryos develop within the mother and are provided with nutrients from a placenta (Viviparity) e.g. smoothhound. World-wide sharks are being removed from our seas at an alarming rate. Yet, they are slow growing, long-lived and have low reproduction rates so it is difficult for their populations to recover. Finning is perhaps the most damaging and distasteful of all shark fisheries. The process is cruel and wasteful, involving the removal and retention of fins, while the rest of the shark, is discarded, often still alive, to drown or be eaten. Fins are consumed principally in the Far East but Europe and the USA are sizeable markets for shark fin. A single basking shark fin can fetch up to 250,000 USD. Blue sharks and other oceanic species are the preferred species taken. Classified as Endangered by the IUCN. They have been heavily exploited and their populations take a very long time to repair (because they grow slowly, mature at a late age and produce very few young). Because of this, they are automatically a red-rated species."

No maternal care is provided to shark pups, instead they are well-developed and ready to hunt when born in order to maximise their chance of survival. All shark eggs are fertilised internally but may develop in one of three different ways: Eggs are held within a leathery case (Oviparity), known as a mermaids purse, e.g. catshark; Embryos develop within the mother and are nourished by the egg (Oviparity) e.g. basking shark; Embryos develop within the mother and are provided with nutrients from a placenta (Viviparity) e.g. smooth-hound. World-wide sharks are being removed from our seas at an alarming rate. Sharks are slow growing, long-lived with low reproduction. Finning is perhaps the most damaging and distasteful of all shark fisheries. The process is cruel and wasteful, involving the removal and retention of fins, while the rest of the shark, is discarded, often still alive, to drown or be eaten. Finning takes place all over the world (including Europe) to feed the continual and increasing demand for sharkfin soup. Fins are consumed principally in the Far East but Europe and the USA are sizeable markets for shark fin. Blue sharks and other oceanic species are the preferred species taken. British seas are home to over 30 shark species including the fastest shark in the world (the shortfin Mako) and the second largest fish in the world (the Basking shark) and we even get tropical rare visitors such as hammerheads. Lesser spotted dogfish populations have been increasing over time with a slight decrease in the past year. Discards are still very high. Better monitoring and management is needed for the stock. Bottom trawling is associated with discarding of unwanted fish, the occasional catch of endangered species and have the potential to cause significant damage to the seafloor. Generally, fisheries managed by inshore management bodies have implemented management measures to reduce this damage."

Processed lobster products include frozen raw lobster tails, frozen whole raw lobster, frozen whole cooked lobster, frozen and fresh cooked lobster meat. The RSPCA recommends freezing lobster for two hours before boiling it. Although some writers and cooks believe this to spoil the texture of lobsters, we strongly believe that the lobster should be treated humanely as the RSPCA advises. When choosing American lobster, look for lobster from the Gulf of Maine, Georges Bank and Marine Stewardship certified fisheries from Canada. Lobsters are relatively slow growing and are long-lived, and as such are vulnerable to exploitation. Avoid eating animals below the legal minimum landing size, egg-bearing or large animals (females) which contribute to the breeding stock. The number of eggs produced by an egg-bearing female is proportional to her size. The majority of American lobster fisheries are not overfished, but fishing is close to the maximum level of fishing effort. However, the Southern New England (SNE) stock is severely depleted and has record low abundance and recruitment due to environmental factors and fishing pressure. Lobster potting is a more selective method of fishing, however, some endangered species are caught in the fishery, e.g. the North Atlantic Right whale which is a cause for concern. Therefore, more effort is required to reduce the impact of lobster fisheries on bycatch species."

A national prohibition on the landing of berried lobster in England was introduced in 2017. There is currently no prohibition on the landing of berried or egg bearing or ovigerous lobster in Wales. Although there is a prohibition in Scotland on the landing of berried or egg-bearing velvet crab, no such restriction exists for female European lobster. The reduction in maximum landing size is however designed to protect larger breeding females as the number of eggs produced by an egg-bearing female is proportional to her size.A ban on landing berried and v-notched lobster significantly increases the spawning potential and resilience of the stock.Lobster potting is a more selective method of fishing than netting as undersized, egg-bearing females or immature animals can be returned to the sea alive.

The Coastal States Arrangement, including fish caught by the Mackerel Industry Northern Sustainability Alliance (MINSA), is a better choice, as these countries continue to work together. In September 2019, all MSC certifications for mackerel were suspended, owing to management not keeping fishing pressure within sustainable levels."

Mussels are widely cultivated and stocks generally considered to be under-exploited. The main methods of harvesting for wild and farmed mussels are dredging and hand-gathering. Hand-gathering is a more selective and sustainable method of harvesting mussels in the wild, and causes less disturbance than mechanical methods.

    "description": "Sharks and rays are found in all the worlds oceans, from the poles to the tropics to shallow water coral reefs to water over 3,000 m deep. The Bull Shark (Carcharhinus leucas) is unusual as it is able to enter fresh water river systems  where it gives birth. Sharks, skates and rays are fish, but they can be distinguished from bony fish (teleosts) by their cartilaginous skeletons. There are four main types of cartilaginous fish; sharks, skates and rays, collectively called elasmobranchs, and the rarely encountered chimaeras, a more distant relative only found in deep water. They are also distinguished from bony fish by the way they breed. Reproduction in sharks and rays is a very slow process as they have a late age of sexual maturity, produce few young and have a long gestation period. No maternal care is provided to shark pups, instead they are well-developed and ready to hunt when born in order to maximise their chance of survival. All shark eggs are fertilised internally but may develop in one of three different ways: Eggs are held within a leathery case (Oviparity), known as a mermaids purse, e.g. catshark; Embryos develop within the mother and are nourished by the egg (Oviparity) e.g. basking shark; Embryos develop within the mother and are provided with nutrients from a placenta (Viviparity) e.g. smooth-hound. World-wide sharks are being removed from our seas at an alarming rate. Sharks are slow growing, long-lived with low reproduction. Finning is perhaps the most damaging and distasteful of all shark fisheries. The process is cruel and wasteful, involving the removal and retention of fins, while the rest of the shark, is discarded, often still alive, to drown or be eaten. Finning takes place all over the world (including Europe) to feed the continual and increasing demand for sharkfin soup. Fins are consumed principally in the Far East but Europe and the USA are sizeable markets for shark fin. Blue sharks and other oceanic species are the preferred species taken. British seas are home to over 30 shark species including the fastest shark in the world (the shortfin Mako) and the second largest fish in the world (the Basking shark) and we even get tropical rare visitors such as hammerheads. In general, consumers should avoid eating nursehound (and all shark species) as they are insufficiently managed, fisheries are data-deficient and the species inherently vulnerable to overexploitation due to their specific biological characteristics (slow-growing, late to mature and producing few young). Nursehound from the Celtic Sea is the better choice as localised populations appear to be stable, or recently decreasing. However, there are insufficient data to fully evaluate stock status."

Further, as a bycatch product from trawling, the production method is a less sustainable option. Choose octopus caught by less damaging capture methods, e.g. pot caught, and avoid beam trawl bycatch octopus. A minimum landing weight of 750g is specified for common octopus, but no minimum landing size is specified for the lesser octopus in European waters. Avoid eating baby octopus which are sometimes offered for sale, as they will not have had a chance to reproduce. Females die after their eggs are hatched, so those appearing for retail sale are either male, or females that have not yet reproduced. Given their biological characteristics and high market value, there is some potential for aquaculture production, although local sustainable fishery management may be more economic. Examples from Japan include the deliberate placement of shelters to enhance stock recruitment."

Adult prawns can walk as well as swim and can climb up vertical surfaces (small waterfalls, weirs, etc.) and cross land. Farmed animals have escaped into the wild. The primary market for this species is for use in Chinese and Indian meals. The giant river prawn is also known as the giant freshwater prawn or freshwater scampi. Freshwater prawn farming occurs in many Asian countries, the main suppliers to the UK market is Bangladesh. Freshwater prawn farming occurs in a similar way to warmwater prawn farming, however there are less environmental concerns as stocking densities and therefore organic pollution is reduced. Large extensive ponds are used, mangroves are not impacted by construction and there is no risk of salinisation of freshwater.The primary negative factor associated with the freshwater prawn sector in Bangladesh is that it is almost exclusively reliant on wild-caught post larvae; this practice leads to high levels of by-catch. Another negative aspect of the industry is that regulations are poorly enforced, since the government lacks capacity. A positive aspect of this industry is that production of freshwater prawns does not generally occur in mangrove areas and does not cause salination of the soil."

    "description": "Prawns are usually sold peeled, cooked and frozen or whole. Pop them in a curry or sling them on a salad. Their tails are used in traditional prawn cocktails - cocked over the side of the glass. The tiger prawn belongs to the largest of  the prawn and shrimp family, the Penaeidae. Its lifecycle may be divided into 6 stages or phases, from embryo to adult, which it completes in one year. The age of sexual maturity varies from 5 to 11 months. They can live up to 2 years in the wild although farmed prawns are usually harvested at 6 months. Farmed prawn accounted for over 90% of the global consumption of prawn in 2013. King prawn is the most commonly farmed species accouting for over 3/4 of production, 99% of which comes from developing countries. Only buy tiger prawns from suppliers that can ensure their product is sourced from farms that comply with environmental standards for habitat protection and impacts of production. Organic farming standards ensures many such standards are met making organic farmed tiger prawns the best choice. Requirements for organic farms include utilisation of byproducts from human consumption fisheries for feed; habitat protection and restoration, limitation on chemical usage, limited stocking densities and strict health and feeding guidelines.Aquaculture Stewardship Council (ASC), Global Aquaculture Alliance Best Aquaculture Practice (GAA BAP 2*, 3*, 4*) and GlobalGap certification ensures some of these standards are met. Look for the organic label on products or ask your supermarket if they have a buying policy for tiger prawns to ensure high production standards are in place, and environmental concerns addressed."

    "description": "Generally stocks of wild Atlantic salmon are depleted. There may be several reasons for this. Factors include: marine mortality, linked to ocean climate and productivity; pollution; environmental changes; aquaculture; freshwater habitat  deterioration; and impediments to migration routes. Due to their migratory behaviour it is difficult to effectively manage individual populations. ICES scientists recommend that fishing for salmon only takes place in rivers where stocks are at full reproductive capacity or above conservation limits. Avoid eating wild-caught salmon from rivers below these limits. For details of rivers above these limits in England and Wales see the Environment Agency and Natural Resources Wales websites. For information on the sustainability of the salmon stocks in rivers in Scotland, see the Marine Scotland website. Salmon is now, however, widely available thanks to fish farming. There have been a number of improvements in the salmon farming industry recently, however there are still some environmental concerns remaining. When buying farmed Atlantic salmon, the best choice to make is organic certified. Organic Certification Standards for salmon farming set comprehensive standards for the cultivation of salmon which includes third party auditing; inspection and enforcement procedures; and standards for hatchery production and feed mill operations, to ensure that the number of negative environmental impacts associated with salmon farming are addressed. Buying organically farmed fish ensures their feed is sourced sustainably, stocking densities are reduced and chemical usage minimised. Salmon certified by the RSPCA Freedom Foods scheme ensure that high welfare standards are met during production, including reduced stocking densities. Alternatively, there are 5 species of Pacific salmon. All Alaskan salmon are certified by the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) or to the Alaska FAO-Based Responsible Fisheries Management (RFM) Certification Programme Standard."

    "description": "Salmon is an oily fish rich in Omega 3. It's a good source of Vitamin D, phosphorous and calcium. Fresh salmom may be baked, grilled or poached. It is also canned, pickled (gravadlax) or smoked. It's also used as a substitute for sushi and  in sashimi. Pacific salmon are a shorter lived species and much more prolific breeders than Atlantic salmon. The Chinook is the most highly prized and expensive of the Pacific salmon from the culinary perspective and most is marketed fresh in North America for human consumption and not frozen or canned, and therefore not likely to be available to European consumers. The Coho is considered as one of the best tasting salmon. It has a higher oil content than Pink and Chum, and is less expensive than eithr Chinook or Sockeye salmon. However it is the least abundant of the Pacific species and therefore of lower commercial importance. Pink salmon is sold frozen or canned in the USA and Europe. The flesh of Chum salmon is typically lighter in colour and lower in oil content than other Pacific salmon but can be firmer in texture and of better flavour than other species. Although some commercial fishers will choose not to fish Chum, in Arctic, western and interior Alaska, Chum is highly sought after as a dried winter food for humans and dogs, and is harvested there in greater numbers than other salmon species. The five species (chinook, chum, coho, pink and sockeye) of Pacific salmon are members of a large family of fish known as salmonidae, which are abundant throughout the temperate zones of the northern and southern hemispheres. Pacific salmon are a shorter lived species and much more prolific breeders than Atlantic salmon. Pacific salmon from fisheries certified to the FAO-Based Responsible Fisheries Management (RFM) Certification Programme or the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) Standard for responsibly managed fisheries is the most sustainable choice for consumers."

    "description": "Fact: same fish - different name depending on size. Young pilchards are often referred to as sardines and are named after the Mediterranean island of Sardinia where they once lived in abundance. They are oily fish with bright silver skins,  related to herrings. Sardines have a strong flavour and are rich in omega-3 fatty acids. Usually cooked whole once gutted, great on the barbecue or ovenbaked. Most commonly bought tinned either in oil or a sauce. Good on toast. Sardines or pilchards (sardine being below 15cm and pilchard above) are caught in the northeast Atlantic, central eastern Atlantic and the Mediterranean Sea. 21 species are canned as sardines, but the European pilchard is the only true sardine. Sardines are commonly caught with purse seine nets and pelagic trawls, which are very selective when used to catch shoaling species and have no impact on the seabed. However, cetacean bycatch can occur. Sardine is a forage species providing prey to many larger fish and marine mammals, so large scale removal can have knock-on effects. Stock status varies and can change rapidly in reaction to variation in climatic conditions. In terms of size, traditionally sardines have been below 15cm in length, the size at which the species matures, and pilchards above - so in terms of size pilchard is the most sustainable option, but a sardine over 15cm will suffice!The Cornish ring-net fishery was certified as a sustainable fishery by the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) in August 2010.The Bay of Biscay and the Southern Brittany purse seine sardine fisheries are also certified. Look for the Blue tick logo on the packaging. The Portugal purse seine fishery has withdrawn from MSC certification."

Sharks, skates and rays are fish, but they can be distinguished from bony fish (teleosts) by their cartilaginous skeletons.

Fins are consumed principally in the Far East but Europe and the USA are sizeable markets for shark fin. Fins may fetch over 30 per kilo and a single basking shark tail fin can fetch up to 5,250 in Hong Kong. Blue sharks and other oceanic species are the preferred species taken. Sawfishes are arguably the most imperiled fishes in the world; the whole family has been classified as Critically Endangered by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Shark Specialist Group.

    "description": "The common or brown shrimp, is found in mainly shallow water along the Eastern Atlantic coast as far south as Morocco, and into the Mediterranean and Black Seas. Brown shrimp is a relatively fast growing and resilient species yet plays a  very important role in the marine ecosystem. It is primarily caught in the North Sea using shrimp trawls. Brown shrimp is primarily caught using shrimp trawls in the North Sea with a very small fishery also occurring in the northeast Irish Sea. Most of the catch is taken in or around the Wadden Sea on the eastern side of the North Sea, which is one of Europe's most important marine conservation areas and national parks. It is important that sufficient areas of these conservation areas are protected to allow natural processes to continue with minimal disruption from fishing. Shrimp trawls are lighter than traditional beam trawls, but can still damage seafloor communities so is important that sensitive areas are protected. Bycatch of juvenile fish remains an issue in these fisheries and further work is needed to improve this, such as trialling of square mesh codends and panels. There are also very few controls in place to prevent the overexploitation of local shrimp populations. Some fleets in the North Sea have voluntarily adopted a harvest control rule which is a positive sign, but cooperation between member states accessing the fishery is needed for this to be effective."

    "description": "Best dusted in flour, fried in butter and eaten on the bone. Lemon sole is also sold filleted and chilled or frozen in breadcrumbs. Doesn't deserve to be made into goujons and doesn't taste of lemon! Belongs to the same family as halibut  and plaice. The fishery for Lemon sole is generally unmanaged in EU waters and there is no minimum landing size (MLS) for the species. An exception to this is in Cornish waters where a MLS of 25cm is enforced by local byelaw. There is no formal assessment of the North Sea stock but analysis of survey data suggests that fishing mortality is below and stock size above sustainable reference points. Choose seine caught fish where possible, as this method of capture causes less damage to the seabed and is the best choice for lemon sole from the North Sea. Avoid eating immature fish (below 25cm) and during its breeding period, April-August."

    "description": "Sharks and rays are found in all the worlds oceans, from the poles to the tropics to shallow water coral reefs to water over 3,000 m deep. The Bull Shark (Carcharhinus leucas) is unusual as it is able to enter fresh water river systems  where it gives birth. Sharks, skates and rays are fish, but they can be distinguished from bony fish (teleosts) by their cartilaginous skeletons. There are four main types of cartilaginous fish; sharks, skates and rays, collectively called elasmobranchs, and the rarely encountered chimaeras, a more distant relative only found in deep water. They are also distinguished from bony fish by the way they breed. Reproduction in sharks and rays is a very slow process as they have a late age of sexual maturity, produce few young and have a long gestation period. No maternal care is provided to shark pups, instead they are well-developed and ready to hunt when born in order to maximise their chance of survival. All shark eggs are fertilised internally but may develop in one of three different ways: Eggs are held within a leathery case (Oviparity), known as a mermaids purse, e.g. catshark; Embryos develop within the mother and are nourished by the egg (Ovoviparity) e.g. basking shark; Embryos develop within the mother and are provided with nutrients from a placenta (Viviparity) e.g. smooth-hound. World-wide sharks are being removed from our seas at an alarming rate. Sharks are slow growing, long-lived with low reproduction. Finning is perhaps the most damaging and distasteful of all shark fisheries. The process is cruel and wasteful, involving the removal and retention of fins, while the rest of the shark, is discarded, often still alive, to drown or be eaten. Finning takes place all over the world (including Europe) to feed the continual and increasing demand for sharkfin soup. Fins are consumed principally in the Far East but Europe and the USA are sizeable markets for shark fin. Blue sharks and other oceanic species are the preferred species taken. British seas are home to over 30 shark species including the fastest shark in the world (the shortfin Mako) and the second largest fish in the world (the Basking shark) and we even get tropical rare visitors such as hammerheads. Spurdog (spiny dogfish, rock salmon or flake) are long-lived, slow growing and have a high age at maturity. These characteristics make them particularly vulnerable to high levels of fishing mortality. The Northeast Atlantic stock is considered to be depleted. The species is assessed as Critically Endangered by IUCN and has been recently added to the OSPAR list of threatened and/or declining species and habitats."

In particular, species native to the Caspian Sea and rivers feeding it have suffered sturgeon habitat loss, destruction of breeding grounds, pollution and mismanaged fisheries. The value of wild sturgeon caviar is so high that there is a substantial illegal fishery for sturgeon that is completely unregulated. Avoid eating wild sturgeon. Due to the lucrative market and demand for caviar, sturgeon aquaculture developed. As wild sturgeon are so depleted, farmed caviar is a better choice.

Deepsea fishing gear is often comprised of heavy bottom towed gear, which is extremely detrimental to the ecosystem, and can decimate productive deepsea areas such as seamounts and oceanic ridges. Static gear has less of an impact on the seabed but is still detrimental to fish stocks and can be easily lost; it will then continue to ghost fish for a long period of time, causing further detriment to deep sea stocks. Avoid eating all deepsea fish species."

    "description": "Whelks are large marine gastropods, or snails, with strong, whitish shells. Whelks are a particularly vulnerable species because they are long-lived, mature late (5-7 years) and produce relatively low number of eggs. They aggregate  together, lay their eggs on the seafloor and are easy to catch. These factors make them more susceptible to local overfishing, and once overfished, have a slow path to population recovery. Avoid eating immature whelks and during their breeding season (autumn and winter). Whelks typically receive a lack of management and their populations are rarely assessed, yet they have undergone sudden market changes due to rising demand from the Far East market. The fishery has grown to Yorkshire, Channel and Welsh regions. Whelk landings in the UK have approximately doubled in both tonnage and value between 2002 and 2012, ranking 3rd in landings in England and 1st in Wales in 2016, worth over 10m pounds and 7m pounds respectively. Whelks are long-lived and susceptible to being overfished. Better management is needed to protect the stock. Avoid eating clams harvested using illegal methods such as electrical fishing. Avoid undersized whelks and whelks caught during their spawning season. Choose whelk from better-managed fisheries e.g. IFCA-managed whelk fisheries."

    "description": "Whiting are mainly a bycatch species and fisheries suffer from high discard rates. Even whiting above the minimum size (27cm) have been observed to be discarded, due to their low market value and sometimes due to quota restrictions. Where  whiting is taken in trawl fisheries for Nephrops or Dublin Bay prawns, which are less selective for whitefish, discarding rates can be as high as 80%. The mandatory use of more selective fishing gears is required to reduce the amount of whiting being discarded if the fisheries are to become sustainable. Ask for, and only eat, whiting from trawlers using approved methods to improve selectivity and reduce discards. Avoid eating immature fish (less than 30cm), and fresh (not previously frozen) fish caught during the spawning season (March-April)."

    "description": "Winkles are gastropod molluscs (having a one-piece coiled shell) that graze on a range of algae. They occur throughout the UK, although they are rare in the Channel Islands and the Isles of Scilly. Winkles form a traditional part of a  seafood platter. Traditionally they are not collected during a month with no R in it. Winkles spawn in the spring and early summer from March until June. Live winkles will need washing in lots of cold water then soaking in a little salted water for 30 minutes before boiling. Boiled in plenty of water, they take 3-4 minutes to cook. Most winkles are collected or gathered by hand, which is a selective method of harvesting that causes less habitat disturbance. Minimum landing sizes for winkles vary between regions, but selecting larger, mature winkles (over 2cm) allows for them to have spawned. There are no stock assessments for winkles and it is highly likely that the harvest is under-recorded. Choose winkles harvested by hand-gathering methods in areas which are well managed."
